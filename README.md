## About this project
It is a simple fragment example based on Advanced Android Training Fragments Codelab with my modifications.

“Switching the device orientation after choosing "No" demonstrates that a Fragment can retain an instance of its data after a configuration change (such as changing the orientation). This feature makes a Fragment useful as a UI component, as compared to using separate Views. While an Activity is destroyed and recreated when a device's configuration changes, a Fragment is not destroyed.”

## Why?
This project is part of my personal portfolio. I will be happy if you give me some feedback. I want to become a better developer!
